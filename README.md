# Brit Test

This tech test is used to

### Explanation

I have choosen django as I could have choosen any other. Because I wanted the capability to do this well with email verification (as it should be when doing authentication) the easiest was to go through it using django.

Otherwise, for the test only would have gone with cherrypy.

### FE

For the frontend, given the simplicity of the app I chose to go with the basic templating instead of doing React (my usual go-to) but having to compile and have to serve the react app compressed, etc.

### Authentication

Cookiecutter sets up authentication out-of-the-box via django

### "Shortcuts"

I have used cookiecutter with the django template from Daniel&Audrey Fieldroy to quickstart the project.

It adds all the configuration as the basis of the application and adds a few libraries off-the-bat so it's very easy to do all the basics (authentication, emailing, remote logging, etc.).

- I haven't taken any more shortcuts.
